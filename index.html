		<h3>My interests</h3>
			<p>Some of my interests include playing football and basketball. My friends and I go to the park often to throw a football around or play a game of hoops. 
			My favorite team in the NFL is the New England Patriots. Whenever I tell people that the pats are my favorite team, they always accuse me of rooting for 
			cheaters. And I always reply, "Have you ever tried throwing a fully inflated football with 5 rings on your fingers?" Another hobby I enjoy is messing around 
			with computer hardware. A while back, a friend helped me build my own gaming computer. He recommended a computer hardware brand named 
			<a href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/">Corsair</a> to me. They have high quality products and great customer service. Building the pc was a 
			really great experience. I would recommend others try it in order to gain a better understanding of computer hardware.
			</p>
			<h3>My family</h3>
			<p>My dad is a pastor at <a href="http://hbcnh.org/">Heritage Batptist Church</a>. Our congregation has about 120 members but the church is growing quickly. My Mom
			homeschools my brother, sister, and I. My brother is my gaming/sports/nerf wars partner. My sister keeps me in line, more or less, and gives me someone to have 
			friendly arguments with.
			</p>
			<h3>Future plans</h3>
			<p>Right now I am taking college classes online in order to get a semester of college knocked out. I plan to go to <a href="https://www.bju.edu/">Bob Jones University</a> 
			in the fall of 2019 to study Computer Science, although am willing to do whatever the Lord has me to do in the future.
